# Introduction
Proof of concept on how to integrate already existing non immersive games in a WebXR application.
I used [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) games in this example as you can export them to self-contained html&js without external dependencies, but this concept could be applied to any game as you just need to get the `canvas` where the game is being rendered.

I loaded the `pico-8` carts using an `iframe` and I resend all the keyboard events the main document gets to that `iframe`.

The `WebXR` version is currently developed to work just with `Oculus Quest` at the moment, but I'll extend the support of other devices later on.
I used the IW WG [WebXR input profiles library](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles) to detect the buttons and axis state and convert it to key events and send them to the pico8 `iframe`.

It's important to notice that when entering VR, the `window.requestAnimationFrame` is not being called, so you should handle it correctly in your game in order to get it rendered and executed properly.
